Code for "Indeterminacy and Imperfect Information"
by Thomas Lubik, Christian Matthes, and Elmar Mertens
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All codes were executed using Matlab R2022b on a Windows 10 desktop. The files listed below can be run in any order. We use the default Matlab random number generator. The seed is set at the top of each file using the rng command. For the equilibrium specific impulse responses (figures 4 and 9) the seed matters - the specific plots produced by the corresponding figures should therefore be thought of as illustrative only.

The code requires access to Matlab's control system toolbox. Should the toolbox be unavailable, please set useDare=false in each script. 

List of files to run (names of files correspond to figures in the main text):
